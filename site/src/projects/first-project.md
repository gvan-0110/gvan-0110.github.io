There are perhaps billions of videos online, and finding a video that is similar to another is quite a task.  For example, say you want a cat video that only takes place during the sunset, finding something like this in a large list of videos would be quite difficult.

This video classifier project was an experiment in order to try to find a way to solve this issue.  It takes a video to look for, and then a group of videos to search.  Then, it looks through the group of videos to find ones closest to the video to look for.

To accomplish this, the program uses a convolutional neural network.
