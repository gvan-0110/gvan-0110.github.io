Hello, my name is Garrison.  I am currently studying at Allegheny College with a major in Computer Science.

The field I am most interested in is machine learning with a focus on data and predictive analytics.

Using predictive analytics, I tie my interest in music with machine learning together to more easily be able to analyze songs and melodies.

When I'm not working on a programming project, I may be found skiing or playing piano in my off time.

If you would like to learn more about what I do, feel free to visit the projects tab in the header above or visit my [LinkedIn](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwje1tLu77f7AhVoFlkFHa8jDlYQFnoECBIQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fgarrison-vanzin-7760141aa&usg=AOvVaw2YOPMlZPNmqAIbgHhbGOLM) and [GitHub](https://github.com/gvan-0110)!
